The code provided here performes a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 2D reservoir to estimate the distribution of STOOIP (and explicitly P10, P50 and P90). 
As input parameters geometrical data for all layers and petrophysical data for all reservoir units are necessary in addition to the information what layer belongs to which unit. 
In addition to the deterministic values also the distributions of the parameters and their necessary parameters need to be provided. 
The result of the code is a figure that summmarizes the obtained results. 
4 charts are provided: a pdf and a cdf of the obtained results, the best fitting normal and log-normal distribution to the data and a chart that shows the percentage of oil in relation to the rock unit (see also example).
